#  Petrol Logistics Analysis

## 📌 Project Objective

This project focuses on analyzing logistics data to uncover **inefficiencies** in cargo transportation—particularly discrepancies in shipment weights and delivery timelines. By identifying patterns of **weight loss** and **delivery delays**, the analysis aims to improve **cargo planning** and **destination logistics** for petroleum shipments.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset named `petrol_logistics`, containing key shipment information including:

* Product Type
* Refinery
* Net weights at origin and destination
* Departure and arrival dates
* Work shift information

---

## 📊 Insights & Outcomes

* **Refinery-specific weaknesses** were identified via weight loss patterns.
* **Work shift schedules** revealed variance in delivery efficiency.
* Certain **product types** exhibited more weight discrepancy, suggesting either handling or measurement issues.
* **Temporal patterns** of shipment volume offered potential planning optimization opportunities.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **SQL** (for querying and data analysis)
* **Relational Database** (assumed: MySQL or compatible system)
* Optional: Power BI / Excel (for data visualization outside SQL)
